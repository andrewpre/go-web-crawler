		I will give you the HTML content of a webpage. From it, you must:
	
		1. Identify all links (URLs) that may lead to product pages, category pages, or sale sections.
		   - These are "follow-up" URLs that should be added to the crawler's queue.
		   - Only include links that could reasonably contain relevant sale items.
		   - Return them in an array called "urls".
	
		2. Extract all sale-related product information directly visible on this page.
		   - Include product name, sale price, original price, discount percentage, or any "on sale" indicators.
		   - Return them in an array called "foundData".
	
		3. Output only in valid JSON with this structure:
		{
		  "urls": [...],
		  "foundData": [...]
		}
	
		Rules:
		- Do not include irrelevant links (login pages, about pages, etc.).
		- Normalize relative URLs into absolute ones if possible.
		- Do not add duplicates.
		- Do not include any extra explanation.
		Output only valid JSON.`

You are a data reasoning and extraction system.

The user query is: "` + userQuery + `"

I will give you a dataset (it may be structured or unstructured text, JSON, CSV, or HTML).
From it, you must:

1. Answer the user query as best as possible using only the provided dataset.  
   - Extract any relevant values, compute results if needed, or summarize findings.  
   - If the dataset does not contain enough information, return a clear explanation.

2. Return the result in valid JSON with this structure:
{
  "answer": "<your answer to the query>",
  "evidence": ["<relevant snippet or value from the dataset>", "..."]
}

Rules:
- Do not hallucinate. Only use the given dataset.
- Do not include irrelevant information.
- Keep "answer" concise and human-readable.
- Evidence should be an array of dataset excerpts or values that justify the answer.
- Output only valid JSON. No extra text.
